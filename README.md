This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior, product performance, and delivery trends in an e-commerce dataset. Key insights include:

üìçRepeat Customers by Region:
Visualizes the concentration of repeat customers across different regions. The North region shows the highest retention rate (71%), highlighting strong brand loyalty and market alignment in that area.

üì¶ Top Repeat Product Categories:
Identifies which product categories have the most loyal customers. Utilidades Dom√©sticas and Telefonia are the most repurchased categories, suggesting opportunities for bundling, upselling,
or cross-promotions.

‚è±Ô∏è Average Delivery Delay by State:
Measures delay times in delivery across states. Coxim, Cuiaba, and Recife exhibit the longest delays, indicating logistics inefficiencies. States like Campo Grande and Marechal Candido Rondon show zero delays, setting operational benchmarks.

üìä Overall Region-wise Distribution:
Compares repeat customer behavior across East, West, North, and South helping to align marketing and supply chain strategy with actual demand.
# Conclusion
The analysis shows a strong connection between customer loyalty and certain product categories, particularly in the North region. However, delivery inefficiencies in key states are creating delays that could affect customer satisfaction and retention.
# Business Strategies Going Forward
‚Ä¢ Improve delivery performance in high-delay states like Coxim and Cuiab√°.

‚Ä¢ Launch targeted marketing campaigns in regions with high repeat engagement (especially North).

‚Ä¢ Increase focus on top-performing product categories for promotions.

‚Ä¢ Monitor underperforming regions to understand low retention and optimize regional logistics and inventory.
